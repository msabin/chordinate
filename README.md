**In Progress**

A virtual keyboard as a remote tutoring tool for piano and music theory.

A MIDI keyboard will make the keys light up and the page acts as a chatroom, except the messages are MIDI data which are represented with the keyboard lighting up.

The purpose is to be able to talk about music with someone else remotely and be able to visually communicate piano chords by being on this webpage.

The frontend is in React and the backend will use sockets.io for this functionality (in progress)
